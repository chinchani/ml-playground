K-means clustering is an unsupervised (no labels/ground truths) technique to
automatically divide data into sub-groups.

Notes:
======
* Useful when not much is known about the data, but perhaps some groupings will
emerge to enable actionable decisions


Analogy:
========

"I have a large backyard filled with leaves. Is it better to rake everything
into one big pile or several small piles?"

Backyard - dataset, leaves - data points, piles - centroids, work - RME
